# MaKeyMaKey-Unity-Test
A simple C# Unity Application to test MaKey Makey within Unity made in Unity 4.3. I have included a published Windows executable along with the source code, just in case someone may want to run this on a Windows machine without having to compile.

The application assumes that you have remapped the MaKey Makey with the following keys
* Up
* DOwn
* Left 
* Right
* W
* A 
* S 
* D 

To remap the MaKey MaKey go to this URL: http://www.makeymakey.com/remap/

When running the application with a MaKey MaKey connected the corresponding graphic will light up when its key is pressed. It will go back to a default state when the key is released.
